# Veritas‑AI Values Survey
A single‑page survey for MIS20070 Section 5 using two ternary plots and Formspree.


## Quick start
1. **Clone** / upload these files into a new GitHub repo and enable **GitHub Pages** (Deploy from `main`, folder `/root`).
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to test locally, or share your GitHub Pages URL to collect data.
3. The page posts each plot separately to Formspree at the endpoint set in `index.html` → `window.FORMSPREE_ENDPOINT`.
4. Use the Python script in `analysis/` to aggregate and plot your results.


## One‑submission per plot
We enforce a client‑side lock with `localStorage`. This is suitable for coursework but not tamper‑proof. If you need stronger controls, add email tokens or server verification.


## Renaming values
If you change value labels, update them in:
- `index.html` (legend + axis titles)
- `script.js` (`AXES_TITLES`)
- `analysis/aggregate.py` (column names)


## Ethics & privacy (suggested text)
We do not collect names or emails by default. Content is limited to the dot position and basic metadata. Participation is voluntary and you may withdraw by closing the tab before submitting.
